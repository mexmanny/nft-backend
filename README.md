## TradeOffs

Given that I gave myself 5 hours to work on this I did not add any extra endpoints to allow a user to make a purchase or add new tokens to the given list. I also only covered basic error validations and did not test all scenarios or edge cases given the time. I would have added integration and unit testing to validate that features were running correctly on build time, more error validation.
